# Wave Scattering & Geometrical Optics Simulation
This project analyzes electromagnetic wave behavior using both numerical and analytical techniques.
It includes two main components:
  1.Electromagnetic scattering from two dielectric cylinders using the Volume Method of Moments (VMoM), with comparison to Born and Rytov approximations.
  2.Ray propagation in an inhomogeneous medium using Geometrical Optics (GO), including ray trajectories, phase accumulation, turning points, caustics, and 2D field mapping.
All simulations are implemented in MATLAB and demonstrate the combination of EM theory, numerical methods, and visualization tools.
